# Ticket Predictor
 I had to create this project for my computer science class in high school. I created this simulation using Python for a hypothetical movie theater to optimize its showing. The similation shows the list of movies in the day, simulates how much revenue each movie made for the day, and the total revenue of the theater that day. 

Ignore the zzz.py file, it doesn't do anything

Program files are the following:
- data folder
- customer.py
- main.py
- movie.py
- movie_showing.py
- screen.py
